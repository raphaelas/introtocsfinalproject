Term Project Readme:

Description:

EcoCity is a one player game modeled after another well known game, SimCity.  Its user purchases city improvements in order to satisfy its rapidly growing population.  The city is displayed on a scrolling map with a corresponding mini map.  Satisfaction decreases every time the population increments by 1,000.  Satisfaction increases whenever certain improvements are built.  Improvement descriptions are displayed in game.

Requirements:

EcoCity can be run from Terminal, entering my term project directory and then typing: python tp.py.  EcoCity is a game developed with pygame 1.9.1 for Python version 2.7 on Macintosh OSX computers.  The game has only been tested on my Macintosh OS X  10.5.8 computer with my pygame 1.9.1 edition for Macintosh.  I downloaded pygame from here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.  The game requires a save file, 4 fonts, and 23 different images stored in the game's folder.  Without the images and fonts, the game will not run.  The entire game code is contained in the file tp.py  The images were not self-drawn; however, they were all photoshopped.  Many were taken from another city building computer game, Civilization IV.
